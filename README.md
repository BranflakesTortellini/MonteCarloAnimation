The main script demonstrates the Monte Carlo method applied to the problem of visiting locations within a circle. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1. It defines the radius and center coordinates of the circle, as well as the number of locations to visit (NUM_LOCATIONS).
2. It generates random locations within the circle using a normal distribution and scales them to fit within the circle's radius.
3. The Monte Carlo search function (monte_carlo_search) is defined. It starts at the center of the circle and iteratively selects the next location to visit based on the distances to the remaining locations. The selection is done using probabilities calculated from the inverse of the distances. The function returns the path of visited locations.
4. The script sets up the figure and initializes the plot.
5. It generates frames by iteratively calling the monte_carlo_search function with an increasing number of locations to visit. It saves each frame as an image.
6. Random colors are generated for the points in each frame to enhance visual distinction.
7. The frames are saved in the "frames" folder.
8. Finally, the script prints a completion message indicating the number of frames saved.

The significance of this script is that it demonstrates how the Monte Carlo method can be used to solve problems where the exact solution is difficult or impossible to find analytically. In this case, it shows how the method can be used to approximate an optimal path for visiting a set of locations within a circle. By visualizing the frames, you can observe the progression of the search and see how the path evolves as more locations are visited.
